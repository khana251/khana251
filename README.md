### Hello there, my name is Amaan! ðŸ‘‹
I am a Computer Science graduate from McMaster University, excited to showcase my passion for coding. Whether it's enhancing my GitHub profile or developing simple games like the 2048 game (https://github.com/khana251/2048-game) and practical tools like AutoFileSorter (https://github.com/khana251/AutoFileSorter), I always find myself engaged in side projects or hobbies during my free time.

Here are some of my skills: PYTHON / JavaScript / HTML / CSS / JAVA / LINUX / C++ / HASKELL / SQL / LaTeX
